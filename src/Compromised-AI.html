                  <p class="u-text u-text-2">One of the fundamental issues with artificial intelligence and machine learning systems as a whole is the problem of "Garbage In, Garbage Out." Poisoning of training data, whether intentional or unintentional, leads to models which behave in a way not intended by the creator or user of the model. Deep learning models which are trained on flawed datasets, such as Amazon's failed hiring AI model, reflect the same flaws they were trained on. Most cases of poisoning are completely accidental, however there is a major cybersecurity risk that leveraging AI exposes. If the organization creating the model has a breach in their data security policies, they are unable to verify the integrity of the data they are using to train models. This lack of integrity means there is a chance for the attacker to inject or mis-label training data such that some perverse outcome occurs. For example, a wanted cybercriminal could hack the national facial recognition database and tag his own face under a different name to avoid detection.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                    <br><b>Engineers and organizations have two steps to mitigate this security risk. To protect against intentional data tampering, data protection is of utmost importance. Regular backups of data lakes and buckets should be kept, and curated datasets should have the same source control policies as source code. To protect against unintended data poisoning, ensure that engineering departments conduct appropriate testing on edge cases, and that the heuristics of predictions match the heuristics that can be expected from the data. For example, making sure the proportion of women who are hired is close in both the actual data and testing results. If there are discrepancies, this signals a poisoning risk that should be investigated.</b>

                  <h2 class="u-subtitle u-text u-text-1">Input Attacks</h2>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-2"> Input attacks trigger an AI system to malfunction by altering the input that
is fed into the system. For example, putting black bars over small parts of a stop sign. By adding this "attack pattern," the AI is confused into mis-categorizing the input as something else. This approach is fundamentally similar to SQL injection, a well-documented problem in web application cybersecurity. Like SQL injection, a malicious pattern is able to cause adverse outcomes, such as leaking data or causing system malfunctions. In some rare cases, such as ANPR (Automated Number Plate Recognition) systems, these two attack vectors can be combined together to attack the system in more places than one. For example , a California engineer attempted to avoid fines by purchasing a "NULL" vanity plate from the DMV. He thought that the ANPR systems for parking and speed enforcment would have sanitized inputs and drop null values from their ticketing system, but was surprised with $12,000 in fines. Whenever a plate was unable to be read, he would be mailed the ticket.&nbsp;<br><b>Just like with traditional applications, shielding AI applications from input attacks with validation is of utmost importance. Artificial Intelligence engineers are able to counteract input attacks by either raising confidence intervals, or having a safe default for uncertain values. For example, a self-driving car would beep and require user intervention if it was unable to read a sign with 85% accuracy.&nbsp;</b>

          <p style="text-align: left;">In 2020, the government allotted $973 Million dollars to non-defense related AI research and development. Compared to the 718 billion dollars that was allotted to the Department of Defense that year, devoting under a million dollars to the technology that is taking over every industry is not nearly enough. With more funding for AI research, techniques to keep systems safer and impervious to attack could be further explored. Donating to organizations such as the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, who are currently researching how to avoid data poisoning by training ML systems to detect when the data given highly deviates from the training data. Another way to get involved is to participate in Zooniverse. Zooniverse is a platform for people-powered research where anyone can volunteer to classify data for different projects. With over a million people participating and classifying the same sets of data for a wide range of research endeavors, the chance of having a bias decreases. These datasets are then used to train ML algorithms to improve search results and make sure the models are trained accurately.&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>How to shield your AI model</h3>
          <h4>AI Suitability Testing</h4>
          <p id="isPasted">When deciding whether to build an AI system, stakeholders should conduct an “AI suitability test” to review the risks associated with the proposed AI system.</p>
          <p>AI suitability tests should focus on answering five questions:</p>
          <ol style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-inline-start:48px;">
            <li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;margin-left: 36pt;">
              <p>Value: What is the value added by the AI system?</p>
            </li>
            <li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;margin-left: 36pt;">
              <p>Ease of Attack: How easy will it be for an adversary to execute an attack on the AI system?</p>
            </li>
            <li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;margin-left: 36pt;">
              <p>Damage: What will be the damage incurred from an attack on the AI system?</p>
            </li>
            <li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;margin-left: 36pt;">
              <p>Opportunity Cost: What are the costs of not implementing the AI system?</p>
            </li>
            <li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;margin-left: 36pt;">
              <p>Alternatives: Are there alternatives to the AI system?</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>The outcomes of these tests should be a study of the risks posed by the AI system, and a determination of how much AI use is appropriate for the given application. This may range from full AI autonomy, through mixed AI/human use with varying degrees of human oversight, to no AI use at all.</p>
          <h4 id="isPasted">Review and update data policies</h4>
          <p>AI users must review and secure their data collection and sharing policies. These reviews are needed because data may emerge as a potent weapon in the age of AI attacks, and steps must be taken to have stakeholders realize the dangers data can now pose. This is especially important because this new danger is in stark contrast with data’s current reputation in society: data is currently regarded pervasively as “digital gold” within the private sector, government, and military. However, because AI is almost wholly dependent on data, data is a direct avenue through which to conduct AI attacks. In this respect, just as Rome’s powerful roads were turned against them by their enemies, AI attacks and other forms of information warfare may similarly turn data from the panacea it is hailed as today into a vulnerability in an AI-dominated society.</p>
          <h4>Secure Soft Assets</h4>
          <p>AI system operators must recognize the strategic need to secure assets that can be used to craft AI attacks, including datasets, algorithms, system details, and models, and take concrete steps to protect them. In many contexts, these assets are currently not treated as secure assets, but rather as “soft” assets lacking in protection. This is because the threat of AI attacks is not widely known, and as such, these critical assets are treated with lower security standards compared to “hard” assets, such as passwords, that are stored with high security standards and encryption. These best practices should be formulated with joint input from security experts and domain experts for each application, and are likely to include changes such as only transmitting data over classified or encrypted networks, encrypting stored data to protect it even if the system is compromised, and keeping system details, such as tools and model hyperparameters, secret.</p>
          <h4>Improve intrusion and attack formulation Detection</h4>
          <p>While hardening soft targets will raise the difficulty of executing attacks, attacks will still occur and must be detected. Policymakers should encourage improved intrusion detection for the systems holding these critical assets, and the design of methods profiling anomalous behavior to detect when attacks are being formulated. While an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, it is imperative to know when prevention has failed so that the system operator can take the necessary mitigation steps before the adversary has time to execute an attack.</p>
          <h4>Create attack response plans</h4>
          <p>Stakeholders must determine how AI attacks are likely to be used against their AI system, and then craft response plans for mitigating their effect. In determining what attacks are most likely, stakeholders should look to existing threats and see how AI attacks can be used by adversaries to accomplish a similar goal. After this, response plans should be designed. Response plans should be based on the best efforts to respond to attacks and control the amount of damage.</p>

          <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4>
          <p>Opponents of strict AI security policies argue that AI is simply another computer program and thus traditional cybersecurity best practices must be enough to cover vectors that make AI vulnerable. However, these same opponents must acknowledge that Cybersecurity is a constantly evolving feed, and every major technological change has the ability to change the game. Cybersecurity paradigms constantly shift, such as from the pre-Internet workstation era to the Internet-enabled era. Before the Internet, cybersecurity practices could be distilled into having a password and keeping offices secure. After the birth of the Internet, servers became connected to a vast network of computers, and the attack methods all revolved around compromising the connection to the network. A wide array of new approaches emerged, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), Remote Access Trojans (RATs), and remote data exfiltration methods. In the last 10 years, the cybersecurity industry has been struggling with a new challenge: the centralization of the modern Internet. With the move to clouds, hybrid clouds, and centralized serverless architecture, system administrators have ever-decreasing control over their infrastructure with the same burden of security. This has led to practices in defense such as sandboxing, Cross-Origin blocking, and the use of cryptography inside the infrastructure of an application. AI, just like Web2.0 and Web1.0, will not exist outside the domain of Cybersecurity, but the domain of Cybersecurity must expand to fit the new attack vectors AI applications introduce.&nbsp;</p>
