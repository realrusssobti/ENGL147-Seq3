          <h2 style="text-align: left;">Boost AI Security in Your Organization</h2>
          <p style="text-align: left;">In 2020, the government allotted $973 Million dollars to non-defense related AI research and development. Compared to the 718 billion dollars that was allotted to the Department of Defense that year, devoting under a billion dollars to the technology taking over every industry is not nearly enough.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">With more funding for AI research, techniques to keep systems safer and impervious to attack could be further explored. Consider donating to organizations such as the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, who currently research methods to avoid data poisoning.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Another way to get involved is to participate in the Zooniverse platform. Zooniverse is a platform for people-powered research where anyone can volunteer to classify data for different projects. With over a million people participating and classifying the same sets of data for a wide range of research endeavors, the chance of having a bias decreases. These datasets are then used to train algorithms to improve search results and make sure the models are trained accurately.&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>How to shield your AI model</h3>
          <h4>AI Suitability Testing</h4>
          <p id="isPasted">When deciding whether to build an AI system, stakeholders should conduct an “AI suitability test” to review the risks associated with the proposed AI system.</p>
          <p>AI suitability tests should focus on answering five questions:</p>
          <blockquote>Value: What is the value added by the AI system?<br>Ease of Attack: How easy will it be for an adversary to execute an attack on the AI system?<br>Damage: What will be the damage incurred from an attack on the AI system?<br>Opportunity Cost: What are the costs of not implementing the AI system?<br>Alternatives: Are there alternatives to the AI system?
          </blockquote>
          <p>The outcomes of these tests should be a study of the risks posed by the AI system, and a determination of how much AI use is appropriate for the given application. This may range from full autonomy to no AI usage at all.</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <h4 id="isPasted">Review and update data policies</h4>
          <p>AI users must review and secure their data collection and sharing policies. These reviews are needed because data may emerge as a potent weapon in the age of AI attacks, and steps must be taken to have stakeholders realize the dangers data can now pose. This is especially important because this new danger is in stark contrast with data’s current reputation in society: data is currently regarded pervasively as “digital gold” within the private sector, government, and military. However, because AI is almost wholly dependent on data, data is a direct avenue through which to conduct AI attacks. In this respect, just as Rome’s powerful roads were turned against them by their enemies, AI attacks and other forms of information warfare may similarly turn data from the panacea it is hailed as today into a vulnerability in an AI-dominated society.</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <h4>Secure Soft Assets</h4>
          <p>AI system operators must recognize the strategic need to secure assets that can be used to craft AI attacks, including datasets, algorithms, system details, and models, and take concrete steps to protect them. In many contexts, these assets are currently not treated as secure assets, but rather as “soft” assets lacking in protection. This is because the threat of AI attacks is not widely known, and as such, these critical assets are treated with lower security standards compared to “hard” assets, such as passwords, that are stored with high security standards and encryption. These best practices should be formulated with joint input from security experts and domain experts for each application, and are likely to include changes such as only transmitting data over classified or encrypted networks, encrypting stored data to protect it even if the system is compromised, and keeping system details, such as tools and model hyperparameters, secret.</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <h4>Improve intrusion and attack formulation Detection</h4>
          <p>While hardening soft targets will raise the difficulty of executing attacks, attacks will still occur and must be detected. Policymakers should encourage improved intrusion detection for the systems holding these critical assets, and the design of methods profiling anomalous behavior to detect when attacks are being formulated. While an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, it is imperative to know when prevention has failed so that the system operator can take the necessary mitigation steps before the adversary has time to execute an attack.</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <h4>Create attack response plans</h4>
          <p>Stakeholders must determine how AI attacks are likely to be used against their AI system, and then craft response plans for mitigating their effect. In determining what attacks are most likely, stakeholders should look to existing threats and see how AI attacks can be used by adversaries to accomplish a similar goal. After this, response plans should be designed. Response plans should be based on the best efforts to respond to attacks and control the amount of damage.</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <hr>
          <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4>
          <p>Opponents of strict AI security policies argue that AI is simply another computer program and thus traditional cybersecurity best practices must be enough to cover vectors that make AI vulnerable. However, these same opponents must acknowledge that Cybersecurity is a constantly evolving field that expands to new threats. Cybersecurity practices constantly shift to match modern demands. In the last decade, the cybersecurity industry has been adapting to the changing technologies of the modern web. Artificial Intelligence is not outside the scope of Cybersecurity, but the domain of Cybersecurity must expand to fit the new attack vectors AI applications introduce.&nbsp;</p>
